## About me

Welcome to my academic page! I am Eric, My Chinese name is Wei Shen (沈蔚), I am excited to share my journey and research endeavors in the field of artificial intelligence.

I completed my bachelor's degree at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) in 2020. Currently, I am a third-year graduate student at Fudan University, working in the NLP Lab under the guidance of [Xuanjing Huang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AnBUn0QAAAAJ&hl=en) as my advisor, with [Qi Zhang](http://qizhang.info/)  as my co-advisor.

I am currently interning at ByteDance AI Lab, where I contribute to cutting-edge research conducted by the Responsible AI team. Under the guidance of my supervisors, [Liu Yang](http://www.yliuu.com/) and Xiaoying Zhang, I explore Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). My time at ByteDance AI Lab has provided invaluable experiences and growth opportunities.

I am passionate about leveraging language models to enhance various aspects of AI and contribute to the development of advanced and responsible AI systems. I am also applying for a Ph.D. in Computer Science, starting in the fall of 2024!

## Research Interests
My research interests primarily revolve around Natural Language Processing (NLP), with a specific focus on LLM alignment, including reward modeling. Additionally, I am eager to explore the realm of LLM agents and contribute to advancements in that area.
